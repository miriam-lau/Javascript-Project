## Project Design
Lullaby was designed and built in four days. A [proposal](./docs/proposal/development_README.md) was drafted with an implementation timeline
during the development process.


## Technology
Lullaby is a website created using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Additional frontend technologies include:
- Buzz: A JavaScript library for playing sounds on the website.
- Anime.js: Animations were created using anime.js and the star burst was modified from Alex Zaworski.
- Sound Fonts: Grand piano music notes were created by jobro (www.freesound.org).
- Youtube: Source for song notes.


## Future Implementations
New features and future implementations are listed in this
[outline](./docs/future_implementations.md).
