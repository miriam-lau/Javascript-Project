Are You Sleeping? (Frre Jacques)
Lyrics
"Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques,"
"Dormez vous? Dormez vous?"
"Sonnez les matines, Sonnez les matines"
"Ding Ding Dong, Ding Ding Dong"

"Are you sleeping, are you sleeping?"
"Brother John, Brother John?"
"Morning bells are ringing, Morning bells are ringing,"
"Ding Ding Dong, Ding Ding Dong."



Baa Baa Black Sheep
Lyrics
"Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any wool?"
"Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full!"

"One for the master,"
"One for the dame,"
"And one for the little boy"
"Who lives down the lane"

"Baa, baa, black sheep,"
"Have you any wool?"
"Yes sir, yes sir,"
"Three bags full..."

"Baa, baa, white sheep,"
"Have you any wool?"
"Yes sir, yes sir,"
"Three needles full."


Baby Mine
Lyrics
"Baby mine, don't you cry."
"Baby mine, dry your eyes."
"Rest your head, close to my heart,"
"Never to part, baby of mine."

"Little one, when you play,"
"Pay no heed, what they say."
"Let your eyes sparkle and shine,"
"Never a tear, baby of mine."

"If they knew all about you,"
"They'd end up loving you too."
"All those same people who scold you,"
"What they'd give just for the right to hold you."

"From your head down to your toes,"
"You're not much, goodness knows."
"But, you're so precious to me,"
"Sweet as can be, baby of mine."


Brahms Lullaby
Lyrics
"Lullaby, and good night, in the skies stars are bright"
"May the moon, silvery beams, bring you with dreams."
"Close you eyes, now and rest, may these hours be blessed"
"Till the sky's bright with dawn, when you wake with a yawn".

"Lullaby, and good night, you are mother's delight"
"I'll protect you from harm, and you'll wake in my arms."

"Sleepyhead, close your eyes, for I'm right beside you."
"Guardian angels are near, so sleep without fear."
"Lullaby, and good night, with roses bedight."
"Lilies o'er head, lay thee down in thy bed."

"Lullaby, and good night, you are mother's delight."
"I'll protect you from harm, and you'll wake in my arms."

"Lullaby, and sleep tight, my darling sleeping."
"On sheets white as cream, with a head full of dreams."
"Sleepyhead, close your eyes, I'm right beside you."
"Lay thee down now and rest, may your slumber be blessed."

"Go to sleep, little one, think of puppies and kittens."
"Go to sleep, little one, think of butterflies in spring."
"Go to sleep, little one, think of sunny bright mornings."
"Hush, darling one, sleep through the night"
"Sleep through the night"
"Sleep through the night"


Hush Little Baby
Lyrics
"Hush little baby don't say a word,"
"Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird."

"And if that mockingbird won't sing,"
"Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring."

"If that ring is made of brass,"
"Mama's going to buy you a looking glass."

"If that looking glass get broke,"
"Papa's going to buy you a billy goat."

"And if that billy goat won't pull,"
"Papa's gonna buy you a cart and bull."

"And if that cart and bull turn over,"
"Papa's gonna buy you a dog named Rover."

"And if that dog named Rover won't bark"
"Papa's gonna buy you a horse and cart."

"And if that horse and cart fall down,"
"You'll still be the sweetest little baby in town."


Little Boy Blue
Lyrics

Rock-a-Bye Baby
Lyrics
"Rock-a-bye, baby"
"In the treetop."
"When the wind blows,"
"The cradle will rock."
"When the bough breaks,"
"The cradle will fall."
"And down will come baby,"
"Cradle and all."

"Baby is drowsing,"
"Cozy and fair."
"Mother sits near,"
"In her rocking chair."
"Forward and back,"
"The cradle she swings."
"And though baby sleeps,"
"He hears what she sings."

"Rock-a-bye baby,"
"Do not you fear."
"Never mind baby,"
"Mother is near."
"Wee little fingers,"
"Eyes are shut tight."
"Now sound asleep,"
"Until morning light."


Somewhere Over the Rainbow
Lyrics
"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high,"
"There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby."
"Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue,"
"And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true."

"Someday I'll wish upon a star,"
"And wake up where the clouds are far,"
"Behind me."
"Where troubles melt like lemon drops,"
"Away above the chimney tops,"
"That's where you'll find me."

"Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly,"
"Birds fly over the rainbow. Why then, oh, why can't I?"

"If happy little bluebirds fly,"
"Beyond the rainbow, why, oh, why can't I?"


Star Light Star Bright
Lyrics
"Star light, star bright,"
"The first star I see tonight;"
"I wish I may, I wish I might,"
"Have the wish I wish tonight."

"Star light, star bright,"
"The first star I see tonight;"
"I wish I may, I wish I might,"
"Have the wish I wish tonight."


Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
Lyrics
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star,"
"How I wonder what you are."
"Up above the world so high,"
"Like a diamond in the sky."
"Twinkle, twinkle little star,"
"How I wonder what you are!"

"When the blazing sun is gone,"
"When he nothing shines upon,"
"Then you show your little light,"
"Twinkle, twinkle, all the night."
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star,"
"How I wonder what you are!"

"Then the traveler in the dark,"
"Thanks you for your tiny spark;"
"He could not see which way to go,"
"If you did not twinkle so."
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star,"
"How I wonder what you are!"

"In the dark blue sky you keep,"
"While you thro' my window peep,"
"And you never shut your eye,"
"Till the sun is in the sky,"
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star,"
"How I wonder what you are!"
